        <h1>Bankroll Management</h1>
        
        <p>This is the most important aspect of poker. More important then any
        hero call you might make, any final table you might get to, bankroll 
        management will determine how long you get to play poker. <br>
        
        I am guilty of having poor bankroll discipline. I have been know to "gamble" and
        take unnecessary shots in games that I had no business being in. And what did I gain? 
        Nothing, I lost money.</p>
